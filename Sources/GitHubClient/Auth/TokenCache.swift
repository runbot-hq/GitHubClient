    /// for example, when a Keychain OAuth token exists (even if not yet read into
    /// the in-memory cache) or when the app is launched from a terminal that already
    /// has `GH_TOKEN` set.
    ///
    /// ## Why this is needed
    /// macOS GUI apps launched from Finder, the Dock, or as a login item are spawned
    /// by `launchd`, which does not source `~/.zprofile` or `~/.zshrc`. As a result,
    /// `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment` does not contain `GH_TOKEN` even when
    /// the token is correctly exported in the user's shell profile. This method
    /// bridges that gap by spawning a login shell subprocess that sources those files.
    ///
    /// ## Why async (not lazy inside `token()`)
    /// `token()` is synchronous and may be called on the `@MainActor` (via
    /// `GitHubClient` → `AppState` which is `@MainActor`-isolated). Blocking
    /// the main thread with `process.waitUntilExit()` for ~50–100 ms would freeze
    /// the UI on every cold Finder launch. Calling `warmUp()` eagerly and
    /// asynchronously from `AppState.start()` before the first poll fires avoids
    /// that entirely: by the time `token()` is first called from a poll, the cache
    /// is already populated.
    ///
    /// ## Fast-path priority (no subprocess if any token source resolves)
    /// warmUp() checks sources in priority order before spawning a shell:
    /// 1. In-memory cache — set by a prior `token()` call or prior `warmUp()`
    /// 2. `TokenStore` (Keychain) — checked explicitly so an OAuth-signed-in user
    ///    never hits the subprocess even on a fresh launch where `token()` hasn't
    ///    run yet. Without this check the Keychain token would be absent from the
    ///    in-memory cache at warmUp() time, the subprocess would run, and an env
    ///    token could beat the Keychain token into cache, inverting priority.
    /// 3. Process environment (`ProcessInfo`) — covers terminal launches and CI.
    /// Only if all three return nil does the shell subprocess run.
    ///
    /// ## Concurrency: fast-path 1 is not atomic with fast-paths 2/3 (intentional)
    /// The cache read in fast-path 1 and the subsequent resolveFromStore() /
    /// resolveFromEnvironment() calls are not a single atomic operation. Two concurrent
    /// callers can both pass fast-path 1 (both see cache == nil) and both call
    /// resolveFromStore(). This results in two Keychain reads, both writing the same
    /// token into cache. This is harmless — the `if $0 == nil` guard inside the Mutex
    /// in resolveFromStore() prevents a double-write, and the Keychain read is
    /// idempotent. Adding a separate initialisation lock to prevent the double-read
    /// would add complexity with no correctness benefit. This is an accepted trade-off,
    /// not a concurrency bug.
    ///
    /// ## Blocking I/O isolation (Principle 18)
    /// The subprocess is run inside `loginShellToken(logger:)`, a `@concurrent`
    /// async free function. `@concurrent` runs off any actor's serial executor,
    /// so `waitUntilExit()` blocks one cooperative thread pool worker without
    /// stalling the caller. No `DispatchQueue` or `DispatchSemaphore` bridges
    /// are used — the timeout is a structured `withTaskGroup` race and the pipe
    /// is drained via `FileHandle.readToEndOfFile()`.
    ///
    /// ## Performance
    /// The subprocess takes ~50–100 ms on first call with a 10-second timeout.
    /// A single `/bin/zsh -i -l` invocation recovers `GH_TOKEN`, falling back to
    /// `GITHUB_TOKEN`, in one shell run. The result is cached on first resolution;
    /// subsequent `warmUp()` calls return immediately.
    ///
    /// ## Token freshness / credential-manager tokens
    /// The login shell is sourced once at startup. If a user's `.zshrc` uses a
    /// credential manager that generates short-lived tokens via command substitution
    /// (e.g. `export GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)`), the token captured at warm-up time
    /// may expire during the app's lifetime. This is an intentional trade-off of the
    /// one-shot design: re-sourcing the shell on every poll cycle would add ~50–100 ms
    /// of latency per poll. In practice, GitHub PATs and OAuth tokens have multi-hour
    /// or multi-day lifetimes; short-lived credential-manager tokens are an exotic
    /// edge case. If token rotation is needed, call `invalidate()` and sign in via
    /// the OAuth flow instead.

/// This makes token extraction immune to any stdout noise a user's .zshrc

/// Marked `@concurrent` so `waitUntilExit()` occupies one cooperative thread

/// `@concurrent` cannot be applied to instance methods on a `Sendable` class
/// without additional actor-annotation gymnastics — the free-function placement
/// is what makes the annotation viable.
///
/// ## stdout pipe drain strategy — sentinel prefix isolation
/// The shell command is:
///     printf 'GH_TOKEN_VALUE:%s\n' "${GH_TOKEN:-${GITHUB_TOKEN:-}}"
/// rather than `echo -n <value>`. This writes the token on its own line with
/// a known prefix. The subprocess arm reads all stdout, splits on newlines,
/// and extracts only the line that starts with `GH_TOKEN_VALUE:`, discarding
/// every other line. Any .zshrc stdout noise (mise initialisation, nvm banners,
/// oh-my-zsh greeting messages, starship prompt setup, etc.) is silently dropped
/// regardless of content — non-whitespace noise included.
///
/// **Why not echo -n + whitespace trim?**
/// `trimmingCharacters` only strips leading/trailing whitespace. A .zshrc that
/// writes even one non-whitespace byte to stdout before the echo would silently
/// cache "<noise><token>" as the token, producing 401s for the entire process
/// lifetime with no diagnostic. Sentinel isolation eliminates this class of
/// corruption entirely.
///
/// stdout is read with `readDataToEndOfFile()` **after** `waitUntilExit()` returns.
/// Reading after exit is safe: the pipe write-end is closed when the process exits,
/// so `readDataToEndOfFile()` returns immediately with whatever was written.
/// There is no pipe-buffer deadlock risk: even a noisy .zshrc that fills stdout
/// will be at most a few KB, well below the ~64 KB kernel pipe buffer; and
/// `waitUntilExit()` only returns after the process exits and closes the write end.
///
/// ## stderr drain strategy
/// stderr is redirected to `FileHandle.nullDevice` (/dev/null). A Pipe() is
/// deliberately NOT used for stderr: if the read end is never drained and the
/// user's .zshrc emits more than the kernel pipe buffer (~64 KB) to stderr,
/// zsh blocks on write() and waitUntilExit() hangs until the 10 s timeout fires.
/// /dev/null has no buffer limit and requires no draining.
///
/// ## Timeout / withTaskGroup race
/// Two arms race inside `withTaskGroup`:
/// - **Subprocess arm**: waits for exit, reads stdout, returns the token or nil.
/// - **Timeout arm**: sleeps 10 s, calls `process.terminate()`, returns nil.
/// `group.next()` returns whichever arm finishes first; `group.cancelAll()`
/// cancels the loser.
///
/// ## group.next() nil ambiguity (not a bug)
/// Both arms return `String?`. A nil from the subprocess (token not found) and
/// a nil from the timeout are indistinguishable via `group.next()`. This is
/// **intentional** — both outcomes produce the same result (no token cached),
/// so disambiguation adds complexity with no benefit. The warmUp() caller logs
/// the outcome accurately via the warmUpInFlight guard.
///
/// ## Task.isCancelled TOCTOU window (accepted trade-off)
/// The subprocess arm checks `Task.isCancelled` before `waitUntilExit()`. There
/// is a narrow window between the check and the call where the timeout arm can
/// win and cancel the task. In that window `waitUntilExit()` still executes —
/// but it returns promptly after SIGTERM, and the subsequent `readDataToEndOfFile()`
/// is a safe no-op on an EOF pipe. The guard eliminates the common case; the
/// narrow window is accepted as an implementation trade-off.
///
/// ## Timeout arm cosmetic log edge case (accepted trade-off)
/// `Task.sleep` throws `CancellationError` on cancellation (caught by `try?`),
/// so `process.terminate()` and the "timed out" log are only reached when the
/// sleep completes naturally. In the rare case where both arms finish
/// near-simultaneously, `process.terminate()` is called on an already-exited
/// process (safe no-op on Darwin) and the "timed out" log fires even though the
/// subprocess succeeded. This is a cosmetic log inaccuracy, not a correctness
/// issue, accepted as a trade-off against adding a result-coordination lock.
///
/// ## Shell expansion
/// `${GH_TOKEN:-${GITHUB_TOKEN:-}}` recovers `GH_TOKEN`, falling back to
/// `GITHUB_TOKEN`, falling back to an empty string. The nested `:-` form is
/// used (not the simpler `${GH_TOKEN:-$GITHUB_TOKEN}`) to be safe under
/// `setopt nounset` / `set -u`: without the explicit empty default, an unset
/// `GITHUB_TOKEN` would cause zsh to abort with "GITHUB_TOKEN: parameter not
/// set", writing nothing to stdout and leaving warmUp() silently unauthenticated.
/// The explicit trailing `:-` provides an empty-string default that satisfies
/// nounset; a sentinel line with an empty value is extracted and rejected by
/// `!value.isEmpty` in the subprocess arm.
/// Priority matches `resolveFromEnvironment()`: GH_TOKEN first, GITHUB_TOKEN
/// as fallback.
///
/// ## -i flag and stdout cleanliness (intentional, not an oversight)
/// `-i` makes zsh run in interactive mode, which is required to source `~/.zshrc`
/// (login-only `-l` sources `~/.zprofile` and `/etc/zprofile` but NOT `.zshrc`).
/// Since most users export `GH_TOKEN` in `.zshrc`, removing `-i` would silently
/// miss their token — the opposite of the intended fix. Stdout noise from
/// interactive mode is handled by the sentinel prefix strategy above, not by
/// avoiding `-i`.
///
/// ## Shell choice: why /bin/zsh and not $SHELL
/// `/bin/zsh` is the macOS system default shell since Catalina (10.15) and is
/// guaranteed to exist at that path on every supported macOS version. This app
/// targets macOS; bash/fish/nushell users are an explicit non-goal for this
/// warm-up path. Using `$SHELL` instead would require per-shell flag negotiation
/// (bash uses `--login`, fish uses `--login --init-command`, nushell has no
/// concept of login shells) and `.zshrc`-equivalent file discovery with no
/// payoff for the target user base. If multi-shell support is ever needed, this
/// function should be refactored with per-shell strategies, not by swapping
/// `/bin/zsh` for `$SHELL`.
///
/// ## Security
/// No user input is interpolated — the shell command is a hardcoded literal.
